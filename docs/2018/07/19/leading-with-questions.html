    <p>Open-ended Questions</p>

<p>• Clarifying: improving the clarity of a message or statement; encouraging more elaboration – “How exactly would you like this done?”
• Reflective: challenging basic assumptions – “Why do we always do it this way?” “Has this ever been tried?”
• Probing: Getting more details; going deeper – “Can you elaborate on why this is happening?”
• Creating connections: asking for systems perspectives – “What will be the consequences of this action?”
• Exploratory: opening up new avenues and insights that lead to new explorations – “Have you considered such a source?”
• Analytical: examining cause and effect, not just symptoms – “Why has this happened?”
• Affective: encouraging sharing of feelings – “How do you feel/how excited are you about this strategy?</p>
