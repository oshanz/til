```sql
"select * from Students"

"select * from Books where studentId=?"
```

Here you have 1 select statement for the student and if you have n number of students you have to fire n more query to select the books. So at the last you have to put n+1 select statement in order to perform this operation.

Now the next question is how to solve it ?

Using join fetching(it will join the parent and children and fetch all the information in a single statement) we can able to solve n+1 problem.
Now our next query will look like this

```sql
"from Students s join fetch s.Books b"
```

<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
<script>
var disqus_config = function () {
    this.page.url = 'http://oshanz.github.io/til/2016/04/04/n+1-query.html';
    this.page.identifier = '2016-04-04-n+1 query';
};

(function() {
var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
s.src = 'https://oshanz.disqus.com/embed.js';
s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
(d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
})();
