```sql
"select * from Students"

"select * from Books where studentId=?"
```
Here you have 1 select statement for the student and if you have n number of students you have to fire n more query to select the books. So at the last you have to put n+1 select statement in order to perform this operation.

Now the next question is how to solve it ? 

Using join fetching(it will join the parent and children and fetch all the information in a single statement) we can able to solve n+1 problem.
Now our next query will look like this

```sql
"from Students s join fetch s.Books b"
```
